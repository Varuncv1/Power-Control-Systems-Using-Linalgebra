# SVD-based Abrupt Change Detection

This repository implements the abrupt change detection heuristic based on the **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** of a *history matrix of differences*, following Sanandaji et al.

---

## What this code does

* Builds, at each time step *t*, a **history matrix of differences**

  $\Delta_t = \big[\, y_t{-}y_{t-1},\ y_t{-}y_{t-2},\ \ldots,\ y_t{-}y_{t-w} \,\big] \in \mathbb{R}^{M\times w},$

  where $y_t$ stacks the $M$ measurement channels at time *t* and $w$ is the window length.
* Computes the **largest singular value** $\sigma_1(\Delta_t)$.
* Uses a **robust baseline threshold** (from a pre-change segment) to flag abrupt changes when $\sigma_1(\Delta_t)$ spikes above the threshold.
* Provides a synthetic demo and CSV-driven workflow, optional per-channel z-scoring, plotting, and CSV export of detection results.

Typical outputs:

* A time series of $\sigma_1(\Delta_t)$ and the threshold.
* A boolean detection mask indicating change points.
* An illustrative plot saved as `*_sigma1_paper.png` when `--save-prefix` is provided.

## The linear algebra method we solve

* **Method:** Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the difference history matrix $\Delta_t$.
* **Detection statistic:** the **spectral norm** (largest singular value) $\sigma_1(\Delta_t)$.
* **Rationale:** An abrupt change behaves like an additive **low-rank (often rank-1) perturbation** to $\Delta_t$, creating a sharp increase in $\sigma_1$. Monitoring this scalar over time detects change points robustly even in the presence of bounded state variation and Gaussian noise (as analyzed in the referenced paper).

> The code mirrors the paperâ€™s construction of $\Delta_t$, tracks $\sigma_1(\Delta_t)$, and uses a robust baseline to decide when a jump indicates a change.
